these are just some helper functions that I (Mario KÃ¶nz) 
use in each of my projects. They contain shorthand functions 
that help to keep the code more readable imo.

add:
**/*.pyc
**/__pycache__
addon/.git
addon/.gitignore

to the .gitignore of the repo that uses this addon (addon should be the actual path to addon)
